# Arena Shooter Calculator

ENG: Simple website that takes your DPI and Sensitivity of CS:GO or Valorant and gives you your eDPI, distance 360/cm, and target sensitivity for cs:go or valorant if you want the same sense across both games.

Shows a chart using Chart.js library, compares your data with the data of 600+ players of CS:GO and Valorant.
This data is stored locally on .JSON files, that are analysed using iteration/repetition loops.
Data was taken from prosettings.net
The chart shows you the mode, median, and mean.

Then it also shows you a table with the most common DPI "jumps" used by mouse manufacturers and the target sensitivity for the game you selected initially. So you keep the same sensitivity between DPI.
This is useful because higher DPI reduces mouse movement input lag.
